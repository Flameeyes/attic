= Attic - v0.4 ALPHA

A place for Ruby objects to hide instance variables.

== Alpha Notice

This library is fresh (est 2009-07-06) and barely tested. It's fun to use but not reliable yet.

== Example

    require 'attic'
    
    String.extend Attic
    String.attic :timestamp
    
    a = "anything"
    a.timestamp = "1980-11-18"
    a.instance_variables          # => []
    a.timestamp                   # 1980-11-18

 
== Some objects have no metaclasses

Symbol and Fixnum objects do not have metaclasses so instance variables are hidden in the object itself.


== Installation

Via Rubygems, one of:

    $ gem install attic
    $ gem install delano-attic --source http://gems.github.com/

or via download:
* attic-latest.tar.gz[http://github.com/delano/attic/tarball/latest]
